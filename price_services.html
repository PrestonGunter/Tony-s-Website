            <h1>1 TONE -- $1.35/SQ.FT.</h1>
            <p>
                A one tone paint job, or a spray out, means that the whole home is being painted one color. 
                The ceilings, trim, doors, and walls would all be the same color.
                 Doing everything one color has it's perks, it's faster to complete for projects that need done quick and it's a cheap alternative.

                A two tone paint job means you get two different colors instead of just one. 
                The ceilings, trim, and doors would all be one color, and the walls would be a different color as well. 
                Takes a little more time but looks really nice because you get a better variety of colors.

              <p>
                A three tone paint job means you get three different colors, which makes for a really nice cohesive and expensive look.
                 The ceilings would be a color of there own, trim and doors a different color, and then the walls another color.
                  This is the most expensive finish but always looks really nice at the end.

                 See who is at the door during the day, and keep the door locked with at night. What’s even better?

              <p>
                There are a lot of reasons to change out your door knobs. 
                Security after a move or change of residents is the obvious reason - but what about getting all those knobs matching for once? 
                Or what about all the cool new finishes they come in? Whatever that reason is, we won’t ask: we’ll just install it the professional away and get it done right.
